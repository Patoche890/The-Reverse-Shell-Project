# The-Reverse-Shell-Project
-Github repo for bypassing AV -->

Hello, welcome to the RVSP github,
This is a python reverse-shell made by me, it may had some bug,
If you want to get the developper~helper.zip key, go see my discord server dedicated :

https://discord.gg/Djswwjpu ---> If the link doesn't work, send a message in the issue part,

Enjoy my tool.

<b>1) Installation</b>

-first, you'll need python 3.12 to get started <br>
-After having been install it run this : pip install -r requirements.txt
-after, change the ip and the port in Client.py
-Then encode it and paste the encoded string into decode.exec-py
-Obfusc the decode-exec code (html-link)
-build the code with Build-Decode-Exec.bat
-Then if you want to use the exe you need to clone the repo where it is
else it will not work.

-Good Luck !
