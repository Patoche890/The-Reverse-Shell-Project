Hello, welcome to the RVSP github,
This is a python reverse-shell made by me, it may had some bug,

Enjoy my tool.

<b>Installation</b>

-first, you'll need python 3.12 to get started <br>
-After having been install it run this : pip install -r requirements.txt <br>
-after, change the ip and the port in Client.py <br>
-Then encode it and paste the encoded string into decode.exec-py <br>
-Obfusc the decode-exec code and past it in a new file(html-link) <br>
-build the file with Build-Decode-Exec.bat <br>
-Then if you want to use the exe located in build folder you need to clone the folder where it is else it will not work. <br>

-Good Luck !
