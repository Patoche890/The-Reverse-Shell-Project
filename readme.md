Enjoy my tool. **ヾ(•ω•`)o**

## **Installation**

**1-** First, you'll need python 3.12 to get started <br>
**2-** After having been install it run this : <b>pip install -r requirements.txt</b> <br>
**3-** Change the ip and the port in Client.py <br>
**4-** Then encode it and paste the encoded string into decode.exec-py <br>
**5-** Obfusc the decode-exec code and past it in a new file(html-link) <br>
**6-** build the file with <b>Build-Decode-Exec.bat</b> <br>
**7-** Then if you want to use the exe located in build folder you need to clone the folder where it is else it will not work. <br>

**<u>-Good Luck !</u>**
